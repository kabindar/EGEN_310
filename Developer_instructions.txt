The code is set to function as a controler for a vehicle.

Bluetooth serial connection begins in 9600 baud.

It includes 2 motors which is set to pin 1 and 2 of the feather wing.

It includes 5 pre-defined speeds, and they're forward, reverse and three diffrent turning speeds to control the vehicle smooth.

In this code we re-program the buttons that are built in the Bluefruit Le app and set to controls required by the developer.

The first 4 buttons consist 4 controls and they're forward, reverse, left and right.

The rest 4 buttons does the same but with different speeds.


The other files which are the BluetoothConfig and packetParser are used to establish connection between the Bluefruit board and the Bluefruit Le app.
These were standard code to connect the bluetooth connection which was taken out from other developers.
